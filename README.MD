# X (formerly Twitter) Post Scraper

A Python-based scraper to extract posts from X (formerly Twitter) based on specified keywords, date ranges, and other criteria. The scraped data is saved in CSV format for easy analysis.

Was originally used for my personal research, notably in the context of `#Terimakasihjokowi` during Prabowo's inauguration back in the end of 2024

Still on WIP, gotta refubrish the codebase and clean it up.
